<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<div>
Welcome to Bootwind UI ‚Äì the ultimate toolkit for creating beautiful, responsive user interfaces with ease. Follow these steps to quickly integrate Bootwind UI into your project.
  
<p></p>
1. Bootwind UI should be installed as a `dependency` of your app.
<p></p>

```sh
yarn add @bootwindproject/bootwindui
```

<p></p>
2. Install deps
Bootwind UI components are styled using CSS in JS. This technique requires a style renderer which inserts CSS into DOM when needed. React context is used to provide the style renderer.
Place a `<BootwindProvider />` at the root of your app and pass theme as a prop.
<p></p>

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BootwindProvider } from '@bootwindproject/bootwindui';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(

<BootwindProvider>
  <App />
</BootwindProvider>
, document.getElementById('root') );
```

<p></p>
3. Usage
That's it. You can now use Bootwind UI components in your app.
<p></p>

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@bootwindproject/bootwindui';

export default () => <Button color="primary">Get started</Button>;
```
